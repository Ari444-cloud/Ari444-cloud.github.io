<h1>Top 3 places when you're in Turks and Caicos</h1>
<h2>The first place to go when you’re on the island is the Grace Bay Beach because it has the most stunning natural beauty and a tranquil atmosphere and the sand is white and the ocean is Crystal clear.</h2>

<h2>Another place to go is the Grand Turk Lighthouse because it is a historic landmark built in 1852 and the U.k and U.S governments decided to build an aid navigation in the lighthouse so now today the lighthouse is no longer in operation and tourists are not allowed access inside.</h2>

<h2>The last place you should go to when you’re in Turks and Caicos is the Turks and Caicos National Museum because it shows houses exhibits on the islands' history and culture</h2>
